# all-rgb-checker
A quick web app to check if an image is a valid `allRGB` according to https://allrgb.com/

Run it with a local server, drag & drop an image, and check for allRGB validity. 

You can find test images on `/static/test-images`.

The `/generators` folder has a few quick scripts to generate simple `allRGB` images.
